    <h2> The three most important macronutrients.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Protein</li>
        <li>Fats</li>
        <li>Carbs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's paramount for individuals to consume a healthy blend of these three macronutriets daily through a clean
        diet. Examples of some of the items that one could add to their diet to fit these needs would be lean chicken
        for a protein source,sweet potatoes for a carb source, and finally avocado or olive oil as a fat source.There's
        thousands, if not a hundred thousand reciepes that you can easily follow to eat healthier.</p>
